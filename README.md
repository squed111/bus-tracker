# Bus Tracker

Description of project:<br>
This project is a project that tracks a bus moving from MIT to Harvard in real time.  With the use of key words like await, this code highlights asynchronous programming.  It also shows the use of API keys. 

How to run:<br>
To run this project, you would of course pull the code and add your own API keys to code.  This code will not run without adding your own API keys from Google Maps and the MBTA.

Plans for imrpovement:<br>
I would like to be able to add a button that would allow for the code to switch through different routes going through the city.  This project highlights route 1, but to be able to see where different buses are in the city by using a search or given options would be nice and helpful.  I would also like to have the code be able to access different cities through locations.  I am unsure as to how to go about doing those at the moment, but with some more research and learning, I think those would be nice additions.
